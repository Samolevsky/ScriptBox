### Window Resizing and Responsive Behavior

ScriptBox is designed to be flexible and adapt to your workspace needs. The panel can be resized and will adjust its layout accordingly.

**Resizing the Panel:**

1. **Docked Panel Resizing**
   - When docked, drag the panel edges to resize
   - Drag horizontally to adjust width
   - Drag vertically to adjust height
   - The panel will snap to other panels and workspace edges

2. **Floating Panel Resizing**
   - When floating, drag any corner or edge to resize
   - Maintain aspect ratio by dragging corners (if desired)
   - Resize freely to fit your screen layout

3. **Minimum Size**
   - ScriptBox has a minimum width and height to ensure usability
   - Content remains accessible even at smaller sizes
   - Some elements may stack or adjust at smaller widths

**Responsive Layout Behavior:**

ScriptBox intelligently adapts to different panel sizes:

- **Wide Panels:** Grid view can display more columns
- **Narrow Panels:** Grid view adjusts to fewer columns or switches to single column
- **Tall Panels:** More items visible without scrolling
- **Small Panels:** Content remains accessible with scrolling
- **Tab Icons:** Always visible regardless of panel size
- **Search Bar:** Adjusts width to fit available space

**Best Practices for Panel Size:**

- **For Grid View:** Use a wider panel to see more items side-by-side
- **For List View:** A narrower panel works well since items stack vertically
- **For Code Editor:** Maximize width for comfortable code editing
- **For Reference Images:** Larger panel size shows images in better detail
- **General Use:** Find a size that balances ScriptBox with your other panels

**Docking Recommendations:**

- Dock ScriptBox alongside your Layers or Swatches panel for easy access
- Keep it floating if you frequently move it between monitors
- Dock vertically on the side of your screen for list-based tabs
- Consider a horizontal dock at the bottom for grid view layouts

The interface is designed to work efficiently at various sizes, so adjust it to fit your personal workflow and screen real estate.

## 4. External Scripts

The External Scripts tab allows you to extend ScriptBox beyond its built-in library by adding your own custom scripts or third-party script collections. This powerful feature lets you integrate personal automation tools, team-shared scripts, or community-developed utilities directly into your ScriptBox workflow.

**Why Use External Scripts?**

- **Expand Your Toolkit:** Add unlimited custom scripts without modifying ScriptBox's core library
- **Team Collaboration:** Share script collections across your team by pointing to a shared folder
- **Personal Automation:** Keep your custom workflow scripts separate from built-in tools
- **Third-Party Integration:** Use scripts from the Illustrator community or marketplace
- **Organized Workflow:** Maintain different script collections for different projects or clients

The External Scripts tab works just like the Toolbox tabâ€”browse folders, search for scripts, and run them with a single click. The key difference is that you control what scripts appear here by choosing which folder to load.

### Adding Custom Script Folders

To use external scripts, you first need to tell ScriptBox where your custom scripts are located. ScriptBox can load any folder containing .jsx, .js, or .jsfl script files.

**Method 1: Using the Folder Button**

1. **Open the External Scripts Tab**
   - Click the External Scripts tab icon (folder icon) at the top of the ScriptBox panel
   - You'll see a drop hint message if no folder is currently set

2. **Click the Folder Button**
   - Look for the folder icon button in the top-right corner of the search bar
   - Click this button to open a folder selection dialog

3. **Select Your Scripts Folder**
   - Navigate to the folder containing your custom scripts
   - Select the folder (not individual files)
   - Click "Select Folder" or "Choose" to confirm

4. **Scripts Load Automatically**
   - ScriptBox immediately scans the selected folder
   - All .jsx, .js, and .jsfl files are detected and listed
   - Subfolders are displayed as collapsible categories
   - Your scripts are now ready to use

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**

For even faster setup, you can drag a folder directly into the External Scripts tab:

1. **Open the External Scripts Tab**
   - Click the External Scripts tab icon

2. **Locate Your Scripts Folder**
   - Open your file system (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows)
   - Navigate to the folder containing your scripts

3. **Drag the Folder**
   - Click and hold on the folder
   - Drag it over the ScriptBox panel
   - Drop it anywhere in the External Scripts tab area

4. **Folder Loads Instantly**
   - ScriptBox automatically sets this as your external scripts folder
   - All scripts are loaded and displayed immediately

**What Happens After Adding a Folder:**

- **Folder Structure Preserved:** Subfolders in your scripts folder appear as collapsible categories in ScriptBox
- **Automatic Organization:** Scripts are automatically organized by their folder structure
- **Folder Name Displayed:** The main folder name appears at the top of the scripts list
- **Persistent Setting:** Your folder path is savedâ€”you don't need to set it again each time you open Illustrator
- **Search Enabled:** You can immediately search through your external scripts
- **Favorites Compatible:** External scripts can be added to your Favorites tab

**Supported File Types:**

ScriptBox recognizes and loads the following script file types:
- **.jsx** - ExtendScript files (most common for Illustrator scripts)
- **.js** - JavaScript files
- **.jsfl** - Flash/Animate script files (if compatible with Illustrator)

**Folder Organization Tips:**

- **Use Subfolders:** Organize scripts into subfolders by category (e.g., "Text Tools", "Color Scripts", "Path Utilities")
- **Clear Naming:** Use descriptive folder and file names for easy identification
- **Remove Extensions:** ScriptBox automatically removes file extensions from display names
- **Consistent Structure:** Maintain a consistent folder structure across projects or team members

**Example Folder Structure:**

```
My Custom Scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ Text Tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Advanced Text Formatter.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Text Case Converter.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Find and Replace Plus.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ Color Utilities/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Color Harmony Generator.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Palette Exporter.jsx
â””â”€â”€ Path Tools/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Advanced Path Cleaner.jsx
    â””â”€â”€ Curve Smoother.jsx
```

This structure would appear in ScriptBox with "My Custom Scripts" as the main folder, containing three collapsible subfolders (Text Tools, Color Utilities, Path Tools), each with their respective scripts.

### Managing External Scripts

Once you've added a custom scripts folder, ScriptBox provides several tools for managing and working with your external scripts.

**Browsing External Scripts**

The External Scripts tab functions similarly to the Toolbox tab:

1. **View Your Scripts**
   - The main folder name appears at the top
   - Subfolders are displayed as collapsible categories
   - Individual scripts are listed within their folders

2. **Expand and Collapse Folders**
   - Click any folder name to expand and see its contents
   - Click again to collapse and hide the scripts
   - Multiple folders can be expanded simultaneously

3. **View Modes**
   - External Scripts supports List View and Compact View
   - The view mode syncs with your Toolbox view preference
   - Switch between views using the Toolbox tab's view toggle
   - Grid view is not available for External Scripts

**Running External Scripts**

Running external scripts works exactly like running built-in scripts:

1. **Click to Run**
   - Simply click any script name to execute it
   - The script runs immediately in Adobe Illustrator
   - Follow any on-screen prompts or dialogs

2. **Script Behavior**
   - Scripts may open dialog boxes with options
   - Some scripts execute instantly without dialogs
   - Selection-based scripts work on currently selected objects
   - Results depend on the individual script's functionality

**Searching External Scripts**

The search functionality helps you quickly find specific scripts in large collections:

1. **Use the Search Bar**
   - Type any part of a script name in the search field at the top
   - Results filter in real-time as you type
   - Search is case-insensitive

2. **Search Behavior**
   - Only matching scripts are displayed
   - Folders containing matches remain visible
   - Non-matching items are hidden
   - Clear the search to see all scripts again

3. **Search Tips**
   - Search works across all subfolders
   - Partial words work (e.g., "text" finds "Text Formatter")
   - Faster than manually browsing through folders

**Adding External Scripts to Favorites**

External scripts can be added to your Favorites tab for even quicker access:

1. **Hover Over a Script**
   - Move your mouse over any external script
   - A star icon (favorite icon) appears on the right

2. **Click the Star Icon**
   - Click the star to add the script to Favorites
   - The script is now accessible from the Favorites tab
   - External scripts in Favorites show a placeholder icon

3. **Access from Favorites**
   - Switch to the Favorites tab to see all your favorite scripts
   - External scripts appear alongside built-in scripts and panels
   - Click to run directly from Favorites

**Refreshing the Scripts Folder**

If you add, remove, or modify scripts in your external folder while ScriptBox is open, use the Refresh button to update the list:

1. **Locate the Refresh Button**
   - Look at the bottom of the External Scripts tab
   - The Refresh button shows a circular arrow icon

2. **Click Refresh**
   - Click the Refresh button
   - ScriptBox rescans your external scripts folder
   - The scripts list updates to reflect any changes

3. **When to Refresh**
   - After adding new scripts to your folder
   - After removing scripts from your folder
   - After renaming scripts or folders
   - After reorganizing your folder structure
   - If scripts don't appear as expected

**Removing Individual Scripts from the List**

You can temporarily hide specific scripts from the External Scripts list without deleting them from your folder:

1. **Hover Over a Script**
   - Move your mouse over the script you want to hide
   - A close icon (X) appears on the right side

2. **Click the Close Icon**
   - Click the X icon
   - The script is removed from the ScriptBox list
   - The script file remains in your folder (not deleted)

3. **Restore Hidden Scripts**
   - Click the Refresh button to restore all hidden scripts
   - Or remove and re-add the entire folder
   - Hidden scripts reappear in the list

**Managing Multiple Script Sources**

While ScriptBox supports one external scripts folder at a time, you can manage multiple script collections:

**Switching Between Folders:**

1. **Remove Current Folder**
   - Click the X icon next to the main folder name at the top
   - Or click the "Remove" button at the bottom

2. **Add Different Folder**
   - Use the folder button or drag-and-drop method
   - Select a different scripts folder
   - The new folder's scripts replace the previous list

**Organizing Multiple Collections:**

- **Master Folder Approach:** Create a master folder with subfolders for different collections
  ```
  All My Scripts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Personal Scripts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Team Scripts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Client A Scripts/
  â””â”€â”€ Community Scripts/
  ```
  Point ScriptBox to "All My Scripts" to access everything at once

- **Project-Based Switching:** Keep separate folders for different projects and switch between them as needed

- **Symbolic Links:** Use symbolic links (shortcuts) to combine multiple script locations into one folder that ScriptBox can read

**Best Practices for Managing External Scripts:**

- **Regular Backups:** Keep backups of your custom scripts folder
- **Version Control:** Consider using Git or similar tools for script version management
- **Documentation:** Include README files in your script folders to document what each script does
- **Testing:** Test new scripts on non-critical documents before using them in production
- **Organization:** Maintain a clear folder structure for easy navigation
- **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent, descriptive names for scripts and folders

### Removing Scripts

ScriptBox provides two levels of script removal: removing individual scripts from the list or removing the entire external scripts folder.

**Removing Individual Scripts**

To temporarily hide specific scripts without deleting them from your computer:

1. **Locate the Script**
   - Browse or search for the script you want to remove
   - The script must be visible in the list

2. **Hover Over the Script**
   - Move your mouse over the script name
   - A close icon (X) appears on the right side of the script

3. **Click the Close Icon**
   - Click the X icon
   - The script immediately disappears from the ScriptBox list

4. **What Happens:**
   - The script is hidden from ScriptBox's interface
   - The actual script file remains in your folder (not deleted)
   - The script is added to a "removed scripts" list
   - The script won't appear even after refreshing

5. **Restore Individual Scripts:**
   - To restore a hidden script, you must remove and re-add the entire folder
   - Or manually edit the removed scripts list (advanced users only)
   - The Refresh button alone won't restore individually removed scripts

**When to Remove Individual Scripts:**

- Scripts you don't use but want to keep in your folder
- Duplicate scripts with similar functionality
- Scripts that aren't compatible with your Illustrator version
- Experimental scripts you're not ready to delete permanently
- Scripts that clutter your list but might be useful later

**Removing the External Scripts Folder**

To completely disconnect your external scripts folder from ScriptBox:

**Method 1: Using the Folder Name Close Icon**

1. **Locate the Main Folder Name**
   - Look at the top of the External Scripts list
   - You'll see your main folder name with an X icon next to it

2. **Click the X Icon**
   - Click the X icon next to the folder name
   - A confirmation may appear (depending on your version)

3. **Folder Removed**
   - All external scripts disappear from the list
   - The drop hint message reappears
   - Your folder path is cleared from ScriptBox

**Method 2: Using the Remove Button**

1. **Locate the Remove Button**
   - Scroll to the bottom of the External Scripts tab
   - Look for the "Remove" button with an X icon

2. **Click Remove**
   - Click the "Remove" button
   - The external scripts folder is disconnected

3. **Folder Removed**
   - All scripts are cleared from the interface
   - The tab returns to its initial state

**What Happens When You Remove the Folder:**

- **Scripts Cleared:** All external scripts disappear from the ScriptBox interface
- **Favorites Updated:** External scripts are automatically removed from your Favorites tab
- **Files Untouched:** Your actual script files and folders remain on your computer (nothing is deleted)
- **Settings Cleared:** The folder path is removed from ScriptBox's settings
- **Removed Scripts List Cleared:** The list of individually removed scripts is reset
- **Ready for New Folder:** You can immediately add a different folder if desired

**After Removing the Folder:**

- The External Scripts tab shows the drop hint message again
- The Refresh button becomes disabled (grayed out)
- The Remove button becomes disabled
- You can add a new folder using the folder button or drag-and-drop

**Re-adding the Same Folder:**

If you remove a folder and later re-add it:
- All scripts reappear in the list
- Previously hidden individual scripts reappear (the removed scripts list was cleared)
- You'll need to hide unwanted scripts again if desired
- Favorites must be re-added manually

**Important Notes:**

- **No File Deletion:** Removing scripts or folders in ScriptBox never deletes files from your computer
- **Safe Operation:** You can safely remove and re-add folders without risk of data loss
- **Favorites Impact:** Removing the external scripts folder removes those scripts from Favorites
- **No Undo:** There's no undo button, but you can simply re-add the folder to restore the list

**Troubleshooting Script Removal:**

- **Script Won't Remove:** Ensure you're clicking the correct close icon (individual script, not folder)
- **Folder Won't Remove:** Try using the Remove button at the bottom instead of the folder name icon
- **Scripts Reappear:** If you only want to hide scripts temporarily, use individual script removal, not the Refresh button
- **Favorites Not Updating:** Manually remove external scripts from Favorites if they don't clear automatically

var rect = doc.pathItems.rectangle(100, 100, 200, 150);
```

**Common JSX Patterns**

**Working with Selections:**
```javascript
// Check if anything is selected
if (app.activeDocument.selection.length > 0) {
    // Loop through selected items
    for (var i = 0; i < app.activeDocument.selection.length; i++) {
        var item = app.activeDocument.selection[i];
        // Do something with each item
    }
}
```

**Creating Shapes:**
```javascript
var doc = app.activeDocument;
// Create a rectangle (top, left, width, height)
var rect = doc.pathItems.rectangle(100, 100, 200, 150);

// Create an ellipse (top, left, width, height)
var circle = doc.pathItems.ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);
```

**Modifying Colors:**
```javascript
var item = app.activeDocument.selection[0];
var newColor = new RGBColor();
newColor.red = 255;
newColor.green = 0;
newColor.blue = 0;
item.fillColor = newColor;
```

**Tips for Writing Scripts**

- **Test Incrementally:** Run your script frequently to catch errors early
- **Use Comments:** Document your code with comments for future reference
- **Save Your Work:** Save useful scripts as .jsx files for reuse
- **Check Selection:** Always verify that objects are selected before manipulating them
- **Handle Errors:** Use try-catch blocks for robust error handling
- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic operations and build complexity gradually

**Learning Resources**

- Adobe Illustrator Scripting Guide (official documentation)
- ExtendScript Toolkit documentation
- Online JSX script repositories and forums
- Built-in ScriptBox scripts (examine them for examples)

### Running Code

Executing your scripts is straightforward with multiple options available.

**Running Scripts from the Editor**

1. **Using the Run Button**
   - Write or paste your code in the editor
   - Click the Run button (play icon) below the editor
   - The script executes immediately in Adobe Illustrator
   - Results appear in your document or as dialogs (depending on the script)

2. **Using Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Press Cmd+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)
   - Faster than clicking for frequent testing
   - Works from anywhere within the editor

3. **Execution Feedback**
   - The script runs in the Illustrator environment
   - Any alerts or prompts defined in your script will appear
   - Check your document for visual changes
   - Console messages appear in the output area (if debug mode is enabled)

**Running Scripts from URLs**

If the editor is empty or contains only the placeholder comment, clicking Run will attempt to load and execute code from the URL field:

1. Paste a script URL in the URL input field at the top
2. Leave the editor empty or clear it
3. Click the Run button
4. The script loads from the URL and executes automatically

**What Happens When You Run Code**

- **Code Validation:** The editor checks for basic syntax errors
- **Execution:** Code is sent to Illustrator's ExtendScript engine
- **Document Changes:** Any modifications to your document take effect immediately
- **Undo Support:** You can undo script actions with Cmd/Ctrl+Z
- **Error Handling:** Syntax errors or runtime errors display as alerts

**Execution Tips**

- **Save Before Running:** Always save your document before running untested scripts

- **Check Requirements:** Ensure required objects are selected or available
- **Read Error Messages:** Error alerts provide clues about what went wrong
- **Iterative Testing:** Make small changes and test frequently

**Common Execution Scenarios**

- **Selection-Based Scripts:** Select objects first, then run the script
- **Document-Wide Scripts:** No selection needed; script affects entire document
- **Generator Scripts:** Create new objects without requiring selection
- **Utility Scripts:** Perform calculations or display information
- **Batch Operations:** Process multiple objects or artboards automatically

### Loading Scripts from URLs

The Code Editor can load scripts directly from the internet, making it easy to run scripts shared online or stored in cloud repositories.

**How to Load Scripts from URLs**

1. **Find a Script URL**
   - Locate a JSX script hosted online (GitHub, Gist, personal website, etc.)
   - Copy the direct URL to the raw script file
   - For GitHub: Click "Raw" button to get the raw file URL

2. **Paste the URL**
   - Click in the URL input field at the top of the Code Editor
   - Paste the script URL (Cmd/Ctrl+V)
   - The URL appears in the input field

3. **Load and Run**
   - Click the "Run script from pasted link" button (play icon next to URL field)
   - Or click the Run button below the editor if the editor is empty
   - The script downloads, loads into the editor, and executes automatically

**What Happens When Loading from URL**

1. **Download:** ScriptBox fetches the script content from the URL

4. **Available for Editing:** The loaded code remains in the editor for modification or re-running

**Supported URL Types**

- **GitHub Raw URLs:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/script.jsx`
- **GitHub Gist URLs:** `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/id/raw/script.jsx`
- **Direct File URLs:** Any publicly accessible .jsx or .js file
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Both protocols are supported

**URL Loading Tips**

- **Use Raw URLs:** For GitHub, always use the "Raw" file URL, not the page URL
- **Check Accessibility:** Ensure the URL is publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- **Verify Content:** The URL should point directly to a script file, not an HTML page
- **Clear URL Field:** Use the Ã— button to clear the URL after loading
- **Save Useful Scripts:** After loading, save scripts you want to keep locally

**Example URLs**

Valid URL format:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/main/scripts/my-script.jsx
```

Invalid URL format (GitHub page, not raw file):
```
https://github.com/username/repository/blob/main/scripts/my-script.jsx
```

**Troubleshooting URL Loading**

- **Failed to Load:** Check that the URL is correct and publicly accessible
- **Wrong Content:** Ensure the URL points to a raw script file, not an HTML page

- **Seasonal Adjustment:** Reorder based on current project needs
- **Keep It Fresh:** Don't be afraid to reorganize as your workflow evolves

### Managing Favorites

Managing your Favorites collection is simple, allowing you to add, remove, and maintain an optimal set of tools.

**Removing Items from Favorites:**

There are two ways to unfavorite items:

**Method 1: From the Favorites Tab**

1. Open the Favorites tab
2. Locate the item you want to remove
3. Click the filled star icon (â˜…) next to the item
4. The star becomes unfilled (â˜†)
5. The item is immediately removed from your Favorites
6. The item still exists in its original location (Toolbox or Panels Manager)

**Method 2: From the Original Location**

1. Navigate to where the item originally appears (Toolbox or Panels Manager)
2. Find the favorited item (it will have a filled star â˜…)
3. Click the filled star icon
4. The star becomes unfilled (â˜†)
5. The item is removed from your Favorites tab

**Both methods work identicallyâ€”use whichever is more convenient.**

**Maintaining Your Favorites:**

**Regular Review:**
- Periodically review your Favorites (monthly or quarterly)
- Remove items you no longer use frequently
- Add new items you've discovered
- Keep your collection lean and relevant

**Quality Over Quantity:**
- Aim for 10-20 favorites rather than 50+
- Too many favorites reduces their effectiveness
- Focus on truly frequent items
- Use search for occasionally-used scripts

**Adapt to Projects:**
- Adjust favorites based on current project types
- Remove project-specific tools when projects end
- Add new tools as you start new types of work
- Keep core tools that apply to all projects

**Learn and Evolve:**
- As you master scripts, you may need them less in Favorites
- Add newly discovered scripts you want to practice
- Your Favorites should evolve with your skill level
- Don't be attached to old favorites if they're no longer useful

**View Modes for Favorites:**

The Favorites tab supports all three view modes, allowing you to choose the display that works best for your collection:

**List View:**
- Default view with full item names
- Best for: Reading full script/panel names clearly
- Ideal when: You have a moderate number of favorites (10-30)
- Shows: Icon, full name, and star icon for each item

**Compact View:**
- Condensed spacing fits more items on screen
- Best for: Larger collections of favorites (20-40)
- Ideal when: You want to see many items without scrolling
- Shows: Same information as list view but with tighter spacing

**Grid View:**
- Visual grid layout with icons and labels
- Best for: Visual recognition and icon-based navigation
- Ideal when: You recognize items by their icons
- Shows: Larger icons in a grid pattern with names below

**Switching View Modes in Favorites:**

1. Open the Favorites tab
2. Look for view mode icons in the top-right corner
3. Click your preferred view mode icon
4. The display updates immediately
5. Your preference is saved for future sessions

**Choosing the Right View Mode:**

- **Use List View if:** You prefer reading names and have moderate favorites
- **Use Compact View if:** You have many favorites and want to minimize scrolling
- **Use Grid View if:** You're a visual person who recognizes icons quickly
- **Experiment:** Try different views to see which feels most natural
- **Switch Freely:** Change views anytime based on your current needs

**Favorites Best Practices:**

âœ“ **Do:**
- Keep your collection focused and relevant
- Reorder items to match your workflow
- Remove items you haven't used in months
- Add items as soon as you notice repeated use
- Use view modes that match your working style

âœ— **Don't:**
- Favorite everything "just in case"
- Let your Favorites become cluttered
- Forget to remove outdated items
- Ignore the organization features
- Stick with one view mode if another works better

**Troubleshooting Favorites:**

**Item Won't Add to Favorites:**
- Ensure you're clicking the star icon, not the item name
- Check that the item type supports favorites (scripts and panels only)
- Try refreshing ScriptBox by closing and reopening the panel

**Can't Reorder Items:**
- Ensure you're clicking and holding on the item itself
- Try dragging more slowly and deliberately
- Check that you're in the Favorites tab (not another tab)

**Favorites Not Saving:**
- Ensure ScriptBox has write permissions to its settings folder
- Try closing and reopening Illustrator
- Check that your ScriptBox installation is complete

**Star Icon Not Visible:**
- Hover over items to ensure the star icon appears
- Check your view modeâ€”some views show stars differently
- Ensure you're using a recent version of ScriptBox

The Favorites system is designed to grow and adapt with you, becoming more valuable the longer you use ScriptBox. Take a few minutes to set up your initial favorites, and you'll quickly wonder how you ever worked without this personalized toolkit.

### Organizing Favorites Effectively

Your Favorites tab is your personal productivity dashboard. Organize it strategically to maximize efficiency.

**Strategic Organization Principles:**

**1. Frequency-Based Ordering:**
- Place your most-used scripts at the top
- Drag-and-drop to reorder items by usage frequency
- Review and reorganize monthly as your workflow evolves
- Keep your top 5-10 scripts immediately visible without scrolling

**2. Task-Based Grouping:**
- Group related scripts together mentally (ScriptBox doesn't have folders in Favorites, but you can order them logically)
- Example order: Selection tools â†’ Arrangement tools â†’ Color tools â†’ Export tools
- Keep scripts you use in sequence near each other
- Place panels you use together adjacent to their related scripts

**3. Workflow-Based Organization:**
- Order favorites to match your typical workflow sequence
- Example: Select by Attribute â†’ Grid Arranger â†’ Color Randomizer â†’ Asset Export panel
- This creates a natural top-to-bottom workflow
- Reduces cognitive load when executing multi-step processes

**Favorites Management Best Practices:**

âœ“ **Do:**
- Start with 10-15 favorites and expand gradually
- Remove items you haven't used in a month
- Add both scripts AND panels to create a complete workflow hub

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Navigation Tips

Master these navigation techniques to work faster within ScriptBox and Adobe Illustrator.

**ScriptBox Navigation:**

**Tab Switching:**
- Click tab icons at the top to switch between features
- Remember the tab order: Toolbox â†’ External Scripts â†’ Panels â†’ Favorites â†’ Code Editor â†’ Tasks â†’ Videos â†’ Reference â†’ Info
- Keep your most-used tab (usually Toolbox or Favorites) as your default

**Search Efficiency:**
- Use **Cmd/Ctrl + F** (if available) to jump to search in applicable tabs
- Type partial words for faster results: "rand" finds all randomizer scripts
- Clear search quickly to return to full view
- Search is case-insensitive, so type naturally

**View Mode Switching:**
- Learn which view mode works best for each task
- Switch to Grid view when browsing visually
- Use List view when you need to read full names
- Use Compact view when you want to see many options at once

**Panel Management:**
- Dock ScriptBox in a consistent location for muscle memory
- Resize the panel to fit your most common view mode
- Keep ScriptBox visible while working (don't auto-hide)
- Consider a second monitor for keeping ScriptBox always visible

**Illustrator Integration:**

**Assigning Keyboard Shortcuts to Scripts:**

While ScriptBox scripts don't have built-in shortcuts, you can create them:

1. **Method 1: Illustrator Actions**
   - Record an Action that runs your script
   - Assign a keyboard shortcut to the Action
   - Access via Window â†’ Actions

2. **Method 2: Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Go to Edit â†’ Keyboard Shortcuts
   - Find your script in the Tools or Menu Commands section
   - Assign a custom shortcut
   - Note: Not all scripts appear in this menu

3. **Method 3: Quick Access**
   - Add frequently-used scripts to Favorites
   - Keep ScriptBox panel visible
   - Single-click execution is often faster than keyboard shortcuts

**Workflow Shortcuts:**

- **Cmd/Ctrl + Z:** Undo script results immediately if not satisfied
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Y:** Toggle between Preview and Outline mode to see script effects
- **Cmd/Ctrl + S:** Save before running destructive scripts
- **Cmd/Ctrl + D:** Duplicate objects before testing scripts on them
- **Cmd/Ctrl + 2:** Lock objects you don't want scripts to affect
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + 2:** Unlock all before running selection-based scripts

**Speed Tips:**

âœ“ **Fast Techniques:**
- Keep ScriptBox docked in the same location always
- Use Favorites for your top 10 scripts
- Learn 3-5 script names and use search instead of browsing
- Run scripts on duplicates first to test results
- Keep frequently-used panels in Favorites alongside scripts

âœ— **Slow Techniques:**
- Constantly resizing or moving the ScriptBox panel
- Browsing through all categories every time
- Not using Favorites
- Running scripts without understanding what they do
- Closing and reopening ScriptBox repeatedly

### Customizing View Modes

Choose the right view mode for each task to optimize your workspace and efficiency.

**View Mode Selection Guide:**

**Use List View When:**
- You're learning ScriptBox and need to read full script names
- You have a narrow panel width
- You're working with scripts that have similar icons
- You want maximum readability
- You're browsing unfamiliar categories

**Use Compact View When:**
- You know script names and want to see more options
- You have limited vertical screen space
- You want to minimize scrolling
- You're working with a long list of favorites
- You need to see many items at once for comparison

**Use Grid View When:**
- You have a wide panel
- You recognize scripts by their icons
- You want a visual, icon-focused interface
- You're browsing the Panels Manager
- You prefer spatial memory over text-based navigation

**Per-Tab Customization:**

Different tabs benefit from different view modes:

**Recommended View Modes by Tab:**

- **Toolbox:** List or Compact (easier to read script names)
- **External Scripts:** List (custom scripts may have less distinctive icons)
- **Panels Manager:** Grid (panel icons are highly recognizable)
- **Favorites:** Compact or Grid (you know these items well)

**Adaptive View Mode Strategy:**

Change view modes based on your current task:

**During Learning Phase:**
- Use List view everywhere
- Read full names and descriptions
- Take time to understand each script

**During Proficiency Phase:**
- Switch to Compact view for frequently-used tabs
- Use Grid view for Panels Manager
- Keep List view for External Scripts

**During Expert Phase:**
- Use Compact or Grid view for everything
- Rely on Favorites tab primarily
- Use search instead of browsing

**View Mode Best Practices:**

âœ“ **Do:**
- Experiment with all three view modes
- Choose different modes for different tabs
- Adjust view mode based on panel size
- Switch modes when your workflow changes
- Use Grid view for visual browsing

âœ— **Don't:**
- Stick with default view mode without trying others
- Use Grid view in a narrow panel (items become too small)
- Use List view when you could fit more items in Compact
- Forget that view modes are per-tab (customize each independently)

**Panel Size and View Mode Relationship:**

| Panel Width | Recommended View Mode |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Narrow (< 250px) | List or Compact |
| Medium (250-400px) | List, Compact, or Grid (2 columns) |
| Wide (> 400px) | Grid (3+ columns) or Compact |

**Visual Preferences:**

**If you prefer:**
- **Text-based navigation** â†’ List or Compact view
- **Visual/icon-based navigation** â†’ Grid view
- **Maximum information density** â†’ Compact view
- **Maximum readability** â†’ List view
- **Balanced approach** â†’ Compact view with occasional Grid for panels
